WPIT (Whose Pet Is That?) is a 1.18.1+ Fabric mod that allows you to easily see the owner of a pet¹. Simply hover your
crosshair over a tamed pet and the owner's name will display above it. This mod is 100% client-side, putting it on the
server will do nothing.

Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config). Optionally, you may
add [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) to access the options screen in-game.

¹Wolves, cats, parrots, horses, donkeys, mules, and llamas.

## Options

Currently, there are four options that can be configured to your liking.

- **Enable mod?** If set to _yes_, the mod will function as intended. If _no_, it will not do anything.
- **Always display nameplate?** If set to _yes_, the name of the owner will be shown regardless of if you're looking at
  the entity.
- **Nameplate scale %** The scale of the owner's nameplate relative to the default size (50 is 50% of the default size).
- **Text color** Changes the color of the owner's nameplate. If you edit this in-game, it will autocomplete valid
  inputs.
