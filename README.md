WPIT (Whose Pet Is That?) is a **Fabric** mod that allows you to easily see the owner of a pet¹. This mod is 100% **client-side**, putting it on the server will do nothing.

Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config). Optionally, you may
add [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) to access the options in-game.

¹A wolf, cat, parrot, horse, donkey, mule, or llama.

## Options

Currently, there are four options that can be configured to your liking.

- **Enable mod?** If set to _yes_, the mod will function as intended. If _no_, it will not do anything.
- **Always display nameplate?** If set to _yes_, the name of the owner will be shown regardless of if you're looking at
  the entity.
- **Nameplate scale %** The scale of the owner's nameplate relative to the default size (50 is 50% of the default size).
- **Text color** Changes the color of owner's nameplate. If you edit this in-game, it will autocomplete valid inputs.
